#Question 1:
#Supervised learning: Machine learning that including prediction, estimation, model selection, and inference.
#To be specific, supervised learning can accurately predict future response given predictors, understand how predictors affect response, select the best model, and assess the quality of predictions and estimation.
#Unsupervised learning don't have a supervisor, and the model work on its own. (From Lec1 pg30)

#Question 2:
